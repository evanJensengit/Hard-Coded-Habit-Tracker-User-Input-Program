//have classes for the date and a way to create classes of previous entries to figure out where
//I stand during the week with the list of tasks to complete like wanting to do 3 scj entries
//3 IFS sessions and 4 cbt sessions, wrkt 3 times a week, sleep 8 hrs a day, meditate 20 mins a day
// and certain amount weekly to add up to a week. I have to have an automatic entry so that if
//I miss a day it says "no entry" but still shows the date on the text editor with "no entry"
//then at the end of the week it pulls all the data from the previous weeks worth of entries and I can
//see what the stats are.
//^^ in the program have a function that pulls the last weeks entries, compiles it and shows
//stats of how much I did/have done. ANd if it is the second day of that week then it knows only to show
//today and the day before stats and no stats from the previous week. Also have a method to show a previous
//week's stats
